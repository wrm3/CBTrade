## Section I: Multi-Agent Tool Coordination Foundation

### Core Orchestration Principles

**TOOL-FIRST COLLABORATIVE APPROACH**: Before any agent implements manual solutions, the orchestration system MUST coordinate available MCP tools across all active agents, optimize tool allocation, and establish collaborative workflows.

**AGENT COORDINATION PRIORITY**:
1. **Cross-Agent Tool Sharing**: Tools utilized by multiple agents for parallel execution
2. **Specialized Agent Tool Assignment**: Dedicated tool ownership for complex operations
3. **Workflow Delegation**: Intelligent task-tool-agent allocation based on capabilities
4. **Collaborative Evidence Gathering**: Multi-agent verification and validation systems

### Always Available Foundational Tools

#### Core System Tools (Available Across All Agents)
- **`fstrent_tasks_v2_setup`** - Initialize coordinated task management across agents
- **`get_datetime`** - Synchronized timestamp functionality for multi-agent coordination
- **`silicon_valley_setup`** - Deploy collaborative development environment
- **`python_execute`** - Distributed code execution and analysis

#### Cross-Agent Communication Tools
