# MANDATORY PRE-CHANGE CHECKLIST

## âœ… BEFORE MAKING ANY CODE CHANGE:

### 1. SCOPE VALIDATION
- [ ] What exactly did the user request?
- [ ] Am I staying within that exact scope?
- [ ] Do I want to do anything beyond the request?
- [ ] If yes â†’ ASK PERMISSION FIRST

### 2. IMPACT ASSESSMENT  
- [ ] Is this a trading system file? (libs/flow_main.py, bot_main.py, etc.)
- [ ] Could this break income generation?
- [ ] Am I modifying business logic?
- [ ] If yes â†’ EXTRA CAUTION + USER CONFIRMATION

### 3. CHANGE STRATEGY
- [ ] Can I make the minimal change possible?
- [ ] Do I need to create new files? (Usually NO)
- [ ] Am I refactoring when I should be patching?
- [ ] Is there a simpler approach?

### 4. SAFETY CHECK
- [ ] Are backups being created in /bkups/?
- [ ] Do I know how to revert this change?
- [ ] Can I test without breaking production?
- [ ] Have I asked if uncertain?

### 5. USER TRUST
- [ ] Will this build or damage user confidence?
- [ ] Am I respecting their explicit requests?
- [ ] Am I being honest about scope?
