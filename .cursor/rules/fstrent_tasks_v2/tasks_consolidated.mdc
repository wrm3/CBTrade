```

---

## I. CORE TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Foundational Architecture

**Single Active Folder:** `.fstrent_tasks_v2/tasks/` holds all active task files with status in YAML frontmatter
**Master Checklist:** `.fstrent_tasks_v2/TASKS.md` - primary control interface kept synchronized
**Archive System:** `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/tasks/` for completed/failed tasks with chronological logging
**Memory Integration:** Mandatory consultation system preventing duplication and providing context

### Directory Structure

```
.fstrent_tasks_v2/
  tasks/          # ALL active task files (task{id}_name.md)
  memory/
    tasks/        # Archived completed/failed task files
    plans/        # Archived PRD files  
    TASKS_LOG.md  # Append-only archived task log
    PLANS_LOG.md  # Append-only plan log
  TASKS.md        # Master checklist of active tasks
```

### Task File Format

**Filename:** `task{id}_descriptive_name.md` (unique sequential ID, kebab-case)
**Sub-tasks:** `task{parent_id}.{sub_id}_descriptive_name.md`

**Next Task ID Process:**
1. List `.fstrent_tasks_v2/tasks/` and `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/tasks/`
2. Parse `task{id}_` pattern (top-level only)
3. Find highest ID + 1 (or 1 if none found)

**YAML Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
id: {id}                   # Numeric (42) or string ("42.1") for sub-tasks
title: 'Task Title'
type: task                 # task|bug_fix|retroactive_fix
status: pending            # pending|inprogress|completed|failed
priority: medium           # critical|high|medium|low
feature: Feature Name
subsystems:                # From SUBSYSTEMS.md registry
  - Core Task Management
project_context: Brief connection to project goal
dependencies:              # Task IDs this depends on
  - 3
  - 5.2
assigned_agent: null       # Agent working (null if not active)
created_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"  
started_at: null           # Set when -> inprogress
completed_at: null         # Set when -> completed/failed
error_log: null            # Failure reason
complexity_score: null     # Automatic assessment (1-10+ scale)
expansion_decision: null   # expansion_applied|bypassed|override
memory_consultation: null  # Historical context reviewed
story_points: null         # Effort estimation (optional)
sprint: null               # Sprint/iteration (optional)
---
```

### Task Priority Assignment

- **critical:** Essential functionality, blocks critical/high tasks
- **high:** Key features, blocks multiple medium/high tasks  
- **medium:** Standard work, valuable but not blocking
- **low:** Nice-to-have, can be deferred

### Task Content Structure

- **Description:** Brief goal summary (for TASKS.md)
- **Details:** Bulleted requirements and steps
- **Test Strategy:** Completion verification method
- **Agent Notes:** Optional execution notes
- **Memory Context:** Historical insights from consultation
- **Complexity Analysis:** Expansion rationale and decisions

---

## II. TASK COMPLEXITY INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

### Automatic Complexity Assessment

**PRE_TASK_CREATION Trigger (MANDATORY)**
**Required Actions:**
1. **Evaluate Task Complexity** using established criteria
2. **Calculate Complexity Score** (1-10+ scale)
3. **Present Expansion Recommendation** if score > 6
4. **Require User Decision** on expansion before proceeding

### Automated Complexity Scoring Criteria

#### Primary Complexity Indicators (High Weight)
*   **Estimated Effort (4 points):** Task likely takes >2-3 developer days
*   **Cross-Subsystem Impact (3 points):** Affects multiple subsystems with different architectural boundaries  
*   **Multiple Distinct Components (3 points):** Changes across unrelated modules, services, or UI areas

#### Secondary Complexity Indicators (Medium Weight)
*   **High Uncertainty/Ambiguity (2 points):** Requirements unclear or many unknown technical challenges
*   **Multiple Logical Outcomes (2 points):** Several distinct, independently verifiable outcomes
*   **Dependency Blocking (2 points):** Large prerequisite for significant number of subsequent tasks

#### Tertiary Complexity Indicators (Low Weight)
*   **Numerous Acceptance Criteria (1 point):** Exceptionally long Details/Test Strategy sections
*   **Story Point Threshold (1 point):** Task assigned >5 story points

### Complexity Scoring Matrix

```
Total Score | Recommendation | Action Required
0-3 points  | Simple Task    | Proceed normally
4-6 points  | Moderate Task  | Consider expansion (TRIGGERED)
7-10 points | Complex Task   | Expansion required (MANDATORY)
11+ points  | High Complex   | Must expand before creation (BLOCKING)
```

### Mandatory Expansion Process

When a task scores ≥7 complexity points:

1.  **Sub-Goal Identification:** System analyzes task objective and breaks into logical, sequential sub-goals
2.  **Subsystem Boundary Alignment:** Sub-tasks aligned with SUBSYSTEMS.md boundaries
3.  **Sub-Task Generation:** System generates structured sub-task proposals
4.  **Mandatory User Confirmation:** User must approve expansion before proceeding

#### Expansion Presentation Format

```
🚨 MANDATORY TASK EXPANSION REQUIRED
Complexity Score: X/10 (EXPANSION REQ'D)
Original Task: "{Original Task Title}"

Proposed Sub-Tasks:
[Detailed sub-task breakdown with priorities and dependencies]

Required Actions:
☐ I approve the expansion into sub-tasks
☐ I want to modify the expansion proposal
☐ I need to reduce original task scope instead
[ EMERGENCY OVERRIDE ] (requires detailed justification)
```

### Sub-Task Creation Workflow

**If expansion approved:**
1. Get sub-task definitions with titles, priorities, dependencies
2. Use `task{parent_id}.{sub_id}_name.md` format
3. List `task{parent_id}.*_*.md`, use highest sub_id + 1
4. Create files with string ID in YAML (e.g., `id: "42.1"`)
5. Update parent task to note expansion
6. Add sub-task entries to `TASKS.md`

### Bypass and Override Mechanisms

#### Approved Bypass Conditions
1. **Simple Maintenance Tasks** - Score ≤2 points, routine updates
2. **Emergency Fixes** - Critical production issues requiring immediate action  
3. **Story Points Under 2** - Explicitly small tasks with validated scope
4. **System Administration** - Infrastructure and tooling maintenance

## III. INTEGRATED MEMORY CONSULTATION SYSTEM

### Memory Architecture

#### Task Archive
- **`.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/tasks/`**: Full archived task files (`task{id}_name.md`)
- **`.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/TASKS_LOG.md`**: Append-only chronological log

#### Plan Archive
- **`.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/plans/`**: Archived PRD files
- **`.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/PLANS_LOG.md`**: Append-only plan log

### Mandatory Consultation Triggers

#### PRE_TASK_CREATION (MANDATORY)
**Trigger:** Before any new task creation
**Actions:**
1. Search TASKS_LOG.md for similar keywords/subsystems
2. Present historical findings with relevance scores
3. Check task dependencies from archived work
4. Require user acknowledgment before proceeding

**User Confirmation:**
```
Historical Context Review:
[Historical findings with relevance scores]

☐ Reviewed similar historical tasks
☐ Understand context and implications  
☐ Proceed with task creation
☐ No similar work OR need different approach
[ EMERGENCY OVERRIDE ] (requires justification)
```

#### POST_TASK_COMPLETION (MANDATORY)
**Trigger:** When 5+ completed tasks in `.fstrent_tasks_v2/tasks/`
**Actions:**
1. Auto-detect completed tasks
2. Present archival list for confirmation
3. Execute archival (move files, update logs)
4. Validate completion

#### PRE_PLANNING (TRIGGERED)
**Trigger:** Before creating/modifying PRDs
**Actions:**
1. Search PLANS_LOG.md for related history
2. Check deprecated plans for value
3. Reference superseded approaches
4. Present planning context

### Memory Log Formats

**TASKS_LOG.md Format:**
```markdown
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Task ID - Status - Title - Agent - Duration
> Dependencies: {deps} (if exist)
> Subsystems: {subsystems} (if exist)
> Complexity: {score}/10 (if assessed)
> Description summary with context
```

**PLANS_LOG.md Format:**
```markdown
- **Archived Plan:** `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/plans/plan-name.md`
  - **Archived On:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## V. AGENT COORDINATION FOUNDATION

### Multi-Agent Task Patterns

This comprehensive system provides foundation patterns for future multi-agent coordination:

#### Specialized Agent Roles
```yaml
agent_specializations:
  task_planning_agent:
    focus: ["dependency_analysis", "complexity_assessment", "timeline_planning"]
    
  memory_intelligence_agent:
    focus: ["historical_analysis", "pattern_recognition", "knowledge_synthesis"]
    
  complexity_assessment_agent:
    focus: ["expansion_evaluation", "sub_task_design", "scope_optimization"]
    
  execution_coordination_agent:
    focus: ["workflow_orchestration", "status_tracking", "resource_allocation"]
```

#### Coordination Protocols
- **Task Assignment Negotiation**: Agents bid on tasks based on capability match
- **Memory Consultation Sharing**: Distributed historical knowledge access
- **Complexity Assessment Collaboration**: Multi-agent expansion evaluation
- **Resource Coordination**: Shared access to task files and status tracking

#### Scaling Patterns
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Independent tasks executed simultaneously
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Multi-agent consensus on complex decisions
- **Distributed Memory Access**: Agents share historical insights across domains
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Task routing based on agent specialization

## VI. SYSTEM OPERATIONS

### Safe File Operations

1. **Check Existence:** Use `list_dir` or `file_search` before operations
2. **File Creation:** Use `edit_file` with initial content if missing
3. **File Moving:** Use `run_terminal_cmd` with `mv` for archival
4. **Appending:** Read existing, append new, write combined content

### Agent Responsibilities

1. **Sync:** Keep `TASKS.md` aligned with task file status
2. **Dependencies:** Verify all dependency IDs have `status: completed` before starting
3. **Memory Consultation:** Execute mandatory historical review
4. **Complexity Assessment:** Evaluate and apply expansion rules
5. **Status Updates:**
   - **Start:** Update YAML (`inprogress`, `assigned_agent`, `started_at`) + `TASKS.md` (`[-]`)
   - **Complete:** Update YAML (`completed`, `assigned_agent: null`, `completed_at`) + `TASKS.md` (`[x]`)
   - **Fail:** Update YAML (`failed`, `assigned_agent: null`, `completed_at`, `error_log`) + `TASKS.md` (`[!]`)
6. **Archive:** Move completed/failed tasks to memory, log to appropriate logs, remove from `TASKS.md`

### Utilities

**Timestamps:** Always use command, never hardcode:
```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```

### Commands

- **Show Tasks:** Display `TASKS.md`
- **Create Task:** Memory consultation + complexity assessment + planning + file creation
- **Start Task:** Find first pending, check dependencies, update if met
- **Complete Task:** Check Test Strategy section, update YAML + `TASKS.md`
- **Archive:** Move completed/failed, log appropriately, remove from active tracking
