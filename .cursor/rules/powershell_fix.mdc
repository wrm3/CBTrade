# CRITICAL POWERSHELL SAFETY RULES

## MEMORY: I will NEVER cause q^D^C issues in PowerShell again.

## NEVER USE THESE COMMANDS IN POWERSHELL ON WINDOWS:
- Multi-line python -c commands
- Complex string operations with quotes
- Commands that could cause parsing issues
- Any command that might result in q^D^C errors

## ALWAYS USE:
- Simple single-line commands
- File-based operations when possible
- Explicit output capture
- Safe command patterns
