# Piano Player Task Documented! ðŸŽ¹

**Date:** October 10, 2025 19:45 UTC  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

---

## What We Just Did

You pointed out that the **MOST IMPORTANT** piece - the "piano player" multi-timeframe candle builder - didn't have its own task!

### The Problem:
- Tasks 001-005 existed
- But Task 000 (the foundation) was missing
- The revolutionary core concept wasn't properly documented as a task

### The Solution:
Created **Task 000: Piano Player Multi-Timeframe Candle Builder**

---

## Task 000 Details

**File:** `.fstrent_tasks_v2/tasks/task000_piano_player_candle_builder.md`

**What It Documents:**
1. **The Piano Player Metaphor:**
   - Each minute = one piano key press
   - Multiple timeframes = chords (notes played simultaneously)
   - Developing candles = sustained notes
   - Completed candles = released notes

2. **The CandleBuilder Class:**
   - Location: `libs/backtest_base.py` lines 397-500
   - Builds candles of any frequency from 1min data
   - Tracks developing + completed candles
   - Detects candle boundaries correctly

3. **Multi-Timeframe Synchronization:**
   - How all frequencies update simultaneously
   - How candles complete independently
   - Why this is revolutionary vs standard backtesting

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - OHLCV update logic (Open/High/Low/Close/Volume)
   - Candle boundary detection (15min, 1h, 4h, 1d)
   - Integration with `_process_minute()` loop

5. **Why This Matters:**
   - Standard backtesting only sees closed candles
   - We see every minute of candle development
   - Captures mid-candle signals
   - Simulates repainting indicators accurately

## Updated Dependencies

**Task 000** â†’ **Task 001** â†’ **Task 002** â†’ **Task 003** â†’ **Task 004** â†’ **Task 005**

The piano player (Task 000) is now the foundation that everything else builds on.

## What The Piano Player Does (Visual)

### Standard Backtesting:
```
Time:     10:00      10:15      10:30      10:45
Check:    âœ“          âœ“          âœ“          âœ“
Result:   4 signals per hour
```

### Piano Player Backtesting:
```
Time:     10:00 â†’ 10:01 â†’ 10:02 â†’ ... â†’ 10:15
15min:    [==DEVELOPING==================COMPLETE]
1h:       [=====DEVELOPING==========================...]
4h:       [========DEVELOPING========================================...]
Check:    âœ“      âœ“      âœ“           âœ“
Result:   15+ signals per 15min candle!
```

**Impact:** Catches signals at 10:07 (mid-candle) that standard backtesting would miss until 10:15!

## Code Implementation Status

### âœ… Already Built (Retroactive Documentation):

1. **`CandleBuilder` Class** (Lines 397-500):
   ```python
   class CandleBuilder:
       def __init__(self, freq):
           # Setup for '15min', '1h', '4h', '1d'
           
       def add_minute(self, timestamp, minute_bar):
           # Add one minute to developing candle
           # Return True if candle completed
           
       def get_completed_candle(self):
           # Return the just-completed candle
           
       def get_current_developing_candle(self):
           # Return the currently developing candle
   ```

2. **Multi-Timeframe Setup** (Lines 117-126):
   ```python
   def initialize_candle_builders(self, freqs):
       for freq in freqs:
           self.candle_builders[freq] = CandleBuilder(freq)
           self.completed_candles[freq] = pd.DataFrame()
   ```

3. **Piano Player Loop** (Lines 190-227):
   ```python
   def _process_minute(self, timestamp, minute_bar):
       # This is the "key press" for each minute
       
       # 1. Update ALL candle builders simultaneously
       for freq, builder in self.candle_builders.items():
           candle_completed = builder.add_minute(timestamp, minute_bar)
           if candle_completed:
               completed_candle = builder.get_completed_candle()
               self._add_completed_candle(freq, completed_candle)
       
       # 2. Update indicators (Task 001)
       # 3. Run buy logic (Task 002)
       # 4. Run sell logic (Task 003)
   ```

## Key Quotes From Your Original Vision

> "at one point I had planned on using the mutiple ohlcv histories that I am saving in the OHLCV database, to create a combined multi timeframe in the same OHLCV to show the minute by minute developing candles to better reflect real trading conditions in particular with indicators that repaint"

> "previous AI models were not capable of helping me figure out all the complexities that such a system would require"

> "it was a rather revolutionary design"

**This is now properly documented as Task 000!** ðŸŽ¹

---

## Why This Was Missing

**Original Planning Oversight:**
- We jumped straight to Task 001 (TA Integration)
- Assumed the piano player was "just implementation"
- Didn't realize it needed its own task

**Why It Matters:**
- This is the CORE innovation
- Everything else depends on it
- It's what makes our system revolutionary
- It deserves top billing as Task 000

---

## Next Steps

The piano player (Task 000) is complete and working!

**Ready to proceed with:**
1. Task 002: Buy Logic Integration (hook to piano player)
2. Task 003: Sell Logic Integration (monitor positions on developing candles)
3. Task 004: Backtest Mode Flag (safety)
4. Task 005: Full validation

---

**The "piano player" is now properly documented and recognized as the foundation of the entire backtesting system!** ðŸŽ¹âœ…

All the complex details of minute-by-minute replay, multi-timeframe synchronization, and developing candle tracking are now captured in Task 000's comprehensive documentation.
