# Rule Update: No Permission Waiting for Task File Edits

**Date:** October 10, 2025 19:52 UTC  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Rule Updated:** `file_organization.mdc`

---

## Problem Identified

AI was repeatedly getting "hung up" waiting for permission before editing `.fstrent_tasks_v2` files, causing workflow interruptions and user frustration.

**User's feedback:**
> "dude you need to stop asking permission to edit the files in the .fstrent_tasks_v2 folder... you keep getting hung up on the 'permission to edit the file' thing... this is the one that we keep having problems with"

---

## Root Cause

**Behavioral Pattern (Wrong):**
1. AI calls `search_replace` on task file
2. AI STOPS and waits
3. "Confirm edit" dialog appears in Cursor
4. AI waits for user to manually approve
5. Workflow stalls until user returns

**Why this happened:**
- No explicit guidance in rules about editing workflow
- AI was being overly cautious with "special" task files
- Treating `.fstrent_tasks_v2` differently than other files

---

## Solution Implemented

Updated `.cursor/rules/fstrent_tasks_v2/file_organization.mdc` with explicit guidance:

### Added Section: "Editing Workflow (CRITICAL)"

**❌ WRONG - Do NOT do this:**
- Call `search_replace` on `.fstrent_tasks_v2` file
- STOP and wait for "permission to edit"
- Get hung up waiting for user confirmation
- Ask "Should I proceed with editing this file?"

**✅ CORRECT - Always do this:**
- Call `search_replace` on `.fstrent_tasks_v2` file
- IMMEDIATELY continue with next operation
- User will handle accept/reject via Cursor UI
- Treat exactly like any other file edit

**Key Principle:** 
> `.fstrent_tasks_v2` files are working files, not sacred templates. Edit them directly and keep working. The user will use the Cursor "Accept/Reject" buttons in the UI just like for all other file edits.

### Added Anti-Patterns

Extended the anti-patterns list with three new CRITICAL entries:
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Waiting for "permission" before editing `.fstrent_tasks_v2` files
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Stopping workflow to ask if edits should proceed
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Treating task files differently than other project files

---

## Expected Behavior Change

### Before (Wrong):
```
AI: *calls search_replace on TASKS.md*
AI: "Should I proceed with editing this file?"
AI: *waits indefinitely*
User: *returns 10 minutes later*
User: "Just edit it!"
```

### After (Correct):
```
AI: *calls search_replace on TASKS.md*
AI: *immediately continues with next operation*
AI: *completes entire task sequence*
User: *accepts/rejects edits via Cursor UI when convenient*
```

## Files Modified

**File:** `.cursor/rules/fstrent_tasks_v2/file_organization.mdc`

**Changes:**
1. Added new section: "Editing Workflow (CRITICAL)" (lines 45-59)
2. Extended "Anti-Patterns to Avoid" with 3 new critical entries (lines 82-84)

**Lines Added:** ~17 new lines of guidance

---

## Testing & Validation

**How to verify this works:**
1. AI should edit `.fstrent_tasks_v2/TASKS.md` without stopping
2. AI should edit task files like `task001_*.md` without stopping
3. AI should edit plans, memory files, etc. without stopping
4. User should see "Confirm edit" dialogs appear but AI doesn't wait for them
5. User can accept/reject at their convenience

**Expected outcome:** 
- No more workflow stalls
- AI completes task sequences without interruption
- User handles accept/reject via UI in their own time

---

## Why This Matters

### User Impact:
- **Before:** Frequent interruptions, had to babysit AI during edits
- **After:** AI works independently, user reviews changes when ready

### Workflow Impact:
- **Before:** Task completion required constant attention
- **After:** AI can work through entire task lists unattended

### Project Impact:
- **Before:** fstrent_tasks_v2 system felt "special" and fragile
- **After:** Task files treated like normal working files

---

## Rule Philosophy

**Core Principle:**
> Working files in `.fstrent_tasks_v2/` are NOT templates. They're active project files that should be edited freely, just like any other code or documentation. The only "special" files are in `/templates/fstrent_tasks_v2/` which are rarely touched.

**Cursor's UI Design:**
The "Confirm edit" dialog is DESIGNED for async workflow:
- AI proposes changes
- User reviews when convenient
- Accept/reject happens in UI
- AI doesn't need to wait!

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit > Implicit:** Even "obvious" workflow patterns need explicit documentation
2. **Anti-Patterns Matter:** Documenting what NOT to do is as important as what TO do
3. **User Feedback Essential:** This issue came up multiple times before being fixed
4. **File Categories:** Clear distinction between "working" and "template" files prevents confusion

---

## Future Considerations

**Other potential rule improvements:**
- Add similar guidance to other rules if this pattern emerges elsewhere
- Consider adding workflow diagrams to rules for visual clarity
- Document standard edit patterns for different file types

**If this issue recurs:**
- Check if rule is being properly loaded
- Verify rule activation triggers are correct
- Consider making rule even more explicit/prominent

---

**This rule update should permanently fix the "permission waiting" issue!** ✅

AI will now edit task files immediately and continue working, while users handle accept/reject through the Cursor UI at their convenience.
