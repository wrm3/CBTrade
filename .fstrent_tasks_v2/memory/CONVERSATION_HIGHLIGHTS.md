# Key Conversation Highlights - Backtesting Project

**Purpose:** Capture critical details from planning sessions that aren't in formal docs  
**Date Range:** October 4-10, 2025  
**Status:** Reconstructed from context

## 🎯 Original Vision & Goals

### The Core Problem Statement
- Current system uses "test transactions" but they don't look far enough back
- Need to cover diverse market conditions (bull, bear, sideways)
- Existing strategies need validation before risking real capital
- Standard backtesting libraries don't work for our multi-timeframe, repainting-indicator strategies

### The Revolutionary Idea (Your Original Concept)
You had planned a system using multiple OHLCV histories to create:
> "a combined multi timeframe in the same OHLCV to show the minute by minute developing candles to better reflect real trading conditions in particular with indicators that repaint"

**Key Quote:**
> "if that old idea has value and you believe that you can help me figure out how to do it, then I would love to revisit that idea"

**Why This Matters:**
- Previous AI models couldn't help implement this complex system
- This is NOT standard backtesting - it's a novel approach
- Simulates indicators as they develop, not just final values
- Captures mid-candle entry signals that standard backtesting misses

## 📊 Data Strategy Decisions

### Why June 2022 - October 2025?
**Your Question:**
> "don't we need to get enough information to cover since before the bull market of 2021, so we have both the ups and downs of the market?"

**Decision:**
- Start: June 1, 2022 (bear market bottom at $17k)
- End: October 4, 2025 (current)
- Covers: Bear market, recovery, 2024 bull run to ATH, consolidation
- Rationale: 3+ years is sufficient for diverse conditions without excessive data

### Why Start with BTC-USDC Only?
**Initial Scope:**
> "test it with only 1 (BTC-USDC) or a few pairs (BTC-USDC, ETH-USDC, SOL-USDC)"

**Reason:** Data requirements
- 1 pair = ~1.76M rows (manageable)
- 3 pairs = ~5M rows (significant but doable)
- 30+ pairs = ~50M+ rows (overkill for initial testing)

**Decision:** BTC-USDC first, expand to ETH/SOL later if needed

---

## 🔧 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limits
**Your Requirement:**
> "slow the api calls with some small sleeps, I have 3 active trade bots running, and I don't want to get API errors"

**Solution:**
- 0.75 second sleep between requests
- Conservative approach to avoid interfering with live trading
- Designed to run in background over several hours

### Challenge 2: Database Performance
**Problem Discovered:** `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` was extremely slow

**Evolution of Solutions:**
1. Initial: Direct insert with duplicate key handling
2. Optimization: Pre-query existing timestamps, insert only new
3. Final: CSV-first approach - collect to CSV, then bulk load

**Result:** Went from 10-15 second delays to sub-second collection

### Challenge 3: Daylight Saving Time Issues
**Your Strong Opinion:**
> "why are we using something that can cause daylight savings timezone issues... we should be using UTC time"

**Solution:**
- Store timestamps as Unix epoch seconds (UTC)
- No DST ambiguity
- Database can still display as datetime for humans
- All calculations in UTC

### Challenge 4: Import Structure Changes
**Issue:** Code was importing from deprecated `bot_cls_main.py`

**Your Requirement:**
> "the backtest code is still importing bot_cls_main, and it should be importing BOT from @bot_base.py"

**Solution:**
- All imports updated to `from libs.bot_base import BOT`
- Database connection strategy revised
- Uses shared `db_ohlcv` instance instead of product-specific connection

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Minute-by-Minute Replay?
**The Problem with Standard Backtesting:**
- Only sees closed candles
- Misses 56 minutes per hour of price action
- Can't simulate indicator repainting
- Mid-candle signals ignored

**Our Solution:**
- Process EVERY minute chronologically
- Build candles as they develop (15min, 1h, 4h, 1d)
- Recalculate indicators every minute
- Detect signals as they happen (mid-candle)

**Real Impact Example:**
- Standard backtest: Entry at candle close = $66,500
- Our backtest: Entry when signal fired = $65,850
- Difference: $650 per trade on BTC!

### Why Not Modify Strategy Files?
**Your Constraint:** Test existing code as-is

**Rationale:**
- Want to know if CURRENT strategies work
- Don't want idealized/optimized versions
- Real-world validation of production code
- Zero changes = zero discrepancies

## 🐛 Notable Bugs & Fixes

### 1. Frequent Beeping Issue
**Your Report:**
> "its going off every 3 seconds multiple times, and I need to log into work in 20 minutes, I can't have it beepingthis much in the background"

**Root Cause:** Multiple `beep()` calls in:
- SHA calculation errors (`bot_ta.py`)
- Trade size below minimum (`buy_base.py`)
- Budget display issues
- Lock verification

**Fix:** Disabled beeps in non-critical error paths

### 2. Live Trades Under $5
**Your Question:**
> "I thought we had changed the buy size logic to be * 5 instead of * 2, how are we still having live trades that are < $5?"

**Root Cause:** Trade size calculation didn't enforce 5x minimum

**Fix:** 
```python
if trade_size < min_size:
    if budget >= (min_size * 5):
        trade_size = min_size * 5  # Meaningful position
    else:
        return 0  # Force test mode
```

### 3. BTC/ETH/SOL Not Buying Live
**Your Question:**
> "Can you look and tell me why we are not buying BTC-USDC, ETH-USDC, SOL-USDC right now?"

**Root Causes:**
1. Hardcoded timing delays (15min product, 60min strategy)
2. Hardcoded profitability threshold (0.025%) too high

**Fix:** Made both configurable in `settings/market_usdc.json`

## 🎪 The "Revolutionary Design" Concept

### What Makes This Revolutionary?

**Standard Backtesting:**
```
Time:  09:00  09:15  09:30  09:45  10:00
Data:  [====][====][====][====][====]  (Only closed candles)
Check: ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓      (5 signals per hour max)
```

**Our Backtesting:**
```
Time:  09:00:01 → 09:00:02 → ... → 09:15:00
Data:  [====                              ]  (Developing 15min candle)
       [========                          ]  (Developing 1h candle)
       [================================  ]  (Developing 4h candle)
Check: ✓        ✓              ✓            (60 signals per hour possible!)
```

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Repainting Indicators:** RSI, MACD, etc. change as candle develops
2. **Mid-Candle Entries:** Most signals fire DURING candle formation
3. **Multi-Timeframe Sync:** All timeframes update simultaneously
4. **Real Conditions:** Simulates exactly what live trading sees

**Accuracy Impact:**
- Standard: "Buy at 10:00 close = $66,500"
- Ours: "Buy at 09:47 (signal time) = $65,850"
- Difference: $650 profit per trade!

## 🔬 Critical Insight: The Partial Candle Problem

**Date:** October 10, 2025

**User's Discovery:**
> "I belive that this is a huge issue with crypto, when you get outside of the normal candle timeframes... is that all of the ohclv that is not perfectly divisible into an hour or day etc... often has its start = to the that dat at midnite (utc often) and so as a result if the timeframe is not equally divisible you get blocks of time shorter than a full candlestick, have the value of a full candlestick"

**The Problem:**
- Most crypto exchanges align candles to midnight UTC
- For non-standard timeframes (7min, 23min, 89min), this creates partial candles
- Example: 7min candles → 1440 ÷ 7 = 205.71... → Last candle of each day is only 5 minutes!
- Indicators calculated on partial candles are WRONG
- Trading signals at day boundaries are INCORRECT
- **Most exchanges have this bug - we can do it RIGHT!**

**Solution 1: Epoch Alignment (Task 000.1 - 4 hours)**
- Align candles to Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) instead of midnight
- Calculate minutes since epoch, divide by candle minutes, multiply back
- Result: ALL candles always exactly full-length
- Candles can cross midnight (this is CORRECT!)
- Supports ANY timeframe (1min through 1 week)

**Solution 2: Rolling Candles (Future Polars TA Integration)**
> "right handed candles, or rolling candles... we are always at the end of the candle regardless of the timeframe used... so if we are doing 5min timeframe and the current time is 10:03am the candle start is 9:58"

- User is developing separate Polars-based TA library
- "Right-handed" window that continuously rolls forward
- At 10:03, 5min candle is 9:58-10:03 (always complete)
- At 10:04, 5min candle is 9:59-10:04 (new complete candle)
- **ALL indicators become repainting** (fundamental shift!)
- Some indicators work better, some worse
- 5x more data (1 candle per minute instead of per period)

**THREE CANDLE PARADIGMS:**
1. **Standard Fixed:** Exchange compatibility (current implementation)
   - Matches exchanges exactly
   - Industry standard
   - Works with predefined timeframes
   
2. **Epoch-Aligned Fixed:** Arbitrary timeframes, no partials (Task 000.1)
   - No partial candles EVER
   - Supports ANY timeframe (3min, 7min, 89min, 1 week)
   - Better for machine learning (consistent lengths)
   - Candles cross midnight (mathematically correct)
   
3. **Rolling:** Continuous updates, always complete (future)
   - Updates EVERY minute (most responsive)
   - Always full-length by design
   - ALL indicators repaint
   - Better for HFT and continuous analysis

**Documentation Created:**
- `.fstrent_tasks_v2/tasks/task000_ENHANCEMENT_arbitrary_timeframes.md` (500+ lines, detailed implementation spec)
- `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/PARTIAL_CANDLE_PROBLEM.md` (visual explanation with ASCII diagrams)
- `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/ROLLING_CANDLES_CONCEPT.md` (complete rolling candles guide)
- `.fstrent_tasks_v2/memory/THREE_CANDLE_PARADIGMS.md` (comparison of all three approaches)
- `.fstrent_tasks_v2/FUTURE_POLARS_INTEGRATION.md` (integration plan for Polars TA)

**Why This Is Revolutionary:**
- Most backtesting systems copy the broken exchange behavior
- We're implementing BOTH solutions (epoch + rolling)
- Will be the most sophisticated backtesting platform in crypto
- Enables accurate ML strategy discovery across arbitrary timeframes
- User's Polars TA library will eventually integrate seamlessly

**This insight separates good backtesting from GREAT backtesting!** 🎯
